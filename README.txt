If you plan to play with it, I'd recommend you to start reading the project documentation:

Check out the wiki, 10 minutes reading it will save you many hours digging through
the code...

If there is something else you have doubts or problems with, send me an email to the
discussion group:

I am happy to help with any issue or just talk about your thoughts.
