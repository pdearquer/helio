# Helio home page #

Helio is an Operating System designed as the result of [several experiments](History.md). At the moment it is not really _operative_, but some parts of it are. These parts are called modules and are explained individually in the [Modules](Modules.md) page.

This project follows a strict [programming style](Coding.md) which is the result of many headaches. If you plan to add some code or use Helio for your experiments, read it carefully and follow the advises, they will save you a lot of time.

The [building instructions](Building.md) will guide you through the process of compiling and running Helio. Please give it a go and let me know!

The email group helio-discuss@googlegroups.com (http://groups.google.com/group/helio-discuss) is the right place to ask questions, make comments, say suggestions or discuss any ideas that the project arouses.
